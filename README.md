## Abstract
Image generation with spatial conditioning has been anactive research topic.  Its application to soccer images en-ables  the  creation  of  synthetic  data  for  training,  contentgeneration, entertainment, and advertising. By incorporat-ing additional control modalities beyond text, spatially con-ditioned image generation models allow fine-grained con-trol  over  the  positions  of  elements  of  interest  in  the  gen-erated images.   However,  when applied to soccer images,these models struggle to precisely control player jersey col-ors and fail to accurately position the soccer pitch withinthe  image.   In  this  work,  we  propose  a  framework  calledSoccerGen that addresses these limitations. It enables pre-cise  control  over  camera  calibration,  the  positions  of  theball and the players, and the colors of player jerseys.  Tothe best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle thechallenges of finely controlled soccer image generation.
